        <h1>Welcome to the Fake News Classifier</h1>

        <p>
            Discover the truth behind news articles with our Fake News Classifier. This web application utilizes a machine learning model, specifically the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, implemented in Python using the Scikit-learn library. The news articles are processed using Pandas DataFrames to facilitate efficient data manipulation.

        <p class="disclaimer">
            Disclaimer: This tool is designed for educational purposes only and should not be used as a sole determinant of the authenticity of news articles. While the algorithm is trained on a diverse dataset, it may not capture all nuances, and the results should be interpreted with caution.

        <h2>Input Page:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Enter a news article in the text area below, and our system will leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify it as either fake or true. The backend Python code employs the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular choice for text classification tasks.

        <h2>Output Page:</h2>
        <p>
            The news has been classified! The backend Python code, backed by Scikit-learn, processes the input through a Multinomial Naive Bayes model trained on a dataset of labeled fake and true news articles. The result is a classification that provides insights into the reliability of the news content.
        </p>

All species of trees are grouped by their genus, family, and order. This helps make identifying and studying trees easier.</p>
                    <p>Apart from providing oxygen for the planet and beauty when they bloom or turn color, trees are very useful. Certain species of hardwood and softwood trees are excellent for timber, making furniture, and paper.</p>
                    <p>When managed properly, trees are a good source of renewable energy and construction material.</p>
